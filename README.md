I can edit this file in IE but cant create new

I wonder if I'll be able to run Chrome on company laptop

OK, this is another branch change that I'm making but I wont merge this time.

Another change in the same session $$ :)

This line was added locally in GIT - did it make it to remote?

Yes it made it!  Now pass back to GIT
